# FinancialNewsAnalysis

# Explanation: Focus on analyzing financial news using AI/ML techniques. It starts by loading financial news data, cleaning it through text preprocessing (removing special characters, stopwords, etc.), and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize sentiment distributions or trends. Feature engineering techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings are likely used to convert text into numerical form. The notebook then applies machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Deep Learning to analyze sentiment or predict market trends. Model evaluation is conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, or other relevant metrics. Finally, results are visualized to gain insights into financial news sentiment and its impact on the market.
